This screenshot demonstrates the process of creating and managing a ticket in osTicket from both an end-user and agent perspective. As an end-user, I created a ticket reporting that the entire mobile/online banking system is down. As a Help Desk Agent (Karen), I observe the ticket's properties, including Priority, Department, SLA, and Assigned To. The ticket is then updated with Sev-A priority (1 hour, 24/7) and assigned to the Online Banking Department. When logged in as Karen, I attempt to view or modify the ticket, testing permissions. Finally, I work the ticket to completion as Jane to resolve the issue. This process illustrates ticket handling, role-based access control, and SLA management.

In this screenshot, I demonstrate the process of handling a ticket from both the end-user and Help Desk Agent (John) perspectives. As an end-user, I create a ticket reporting that the Accounting Department needs an Adobe upgrade due to a broken installation. As John, I review the ticket’s key properties, including Priority, Department, SLA, and Assigned To. I then update the ticket with a Sev-B priority (4 hours, 24/7) and assign it to the Support department. Finally, I resolve the ticket as John, completing the support request. This workflow highlights ticket creation, property configuration, and completion from an agent's perspective.

This screenshot illustrates the process of creating and managing a ticket from the end-user and Help Desk Agent (John) perspectives. As the end-user, I submit a ticket reporting that the CFO’s laptop won’t power on. When logged in as John, the Help Desk Agent, I review the ticket’s details, including its Priority, Department, SLA, and Assigned To fields. I then set the ticket's priority to Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7) and assign it to the Support department. Finally, as John, I work through the issue and resolve the ticket. This example demonstrates how tickets are created, categorized, and resolved by agents within a support system.
